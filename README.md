Hangman Game
Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game. The player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.

How to Play
The game randomly selects a word, and the player has to guess the word one letter at a time.
The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses represented by parts of a hangman.
For each correct guess, the letter is revealed in the word. Incorrect guesses will reduce the number of remaining attempts.
The player wins if they can guess all the letters in the word before running out of attempts.
The game ends when either the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of guesses.
